    "The Pi can control LEDs, turning them on or off, drive motors, and interact with many other objects. It can also detect the pressing of a switch, change in temperature, or light, etc, by attaching kinds of sensors. We refer to all these activities, and more, as physical computing.\n",

    "These pins are a physical interface between the Raspberry Pi and the outside world. Using them, you can program the Raspberry Pi to switch devices on and off (output), or receive data from sensors and switches (input). Of the 40 pins, 26 are GPIO pins and the others are power or ground pins (plus two ID EEPROM pins which you should not play with unless you know your stuff!)\n",
