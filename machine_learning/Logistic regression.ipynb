    "### Feature scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression with regularization (C = 1) penalizes the model the stronger for features with greater weights. Therefore, for linear methods with regularization, it is recommended to convert features to the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is standardization: for each observation you need to subtract the average value of the feature and divide this difference by the standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{*}_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i} - \\mu_x}{\\sigma_x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following practical tips can be given:\n",
    "- It is recommended to scale features if they have essentially different ranges or different units of measurement (for example, the country's population is indicated in units, and the country's GNP in trillions)\n",
    "- Scale features if you do not have a reason/expert opinion to give a greater weight to any of them\n",
    "- Scaling can be excessive if the ranges of some of your features differ from each other, but they are in the same system of units (for example, the proportion of middle-aged people and people over 80 among the entire population)\n",
    "- If you want to get an interpreted model, then build a model without regularization and scaling (most likely, its quality will be worse)\n",
    "- Binary features (which take only values of 0 or 1) are usually left without conversion, (but)\n",
    "- If the quality of the model is crucial, try different options and select one where the quality is better"
